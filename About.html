        <h3> Who I am?</h3>
       <p >
        I am Ayushi Baghel, a Computer Science graduate with a passion
        for frontend engineering and user-centric design. I enjoy 
        transforming ideas into interactive, responsive, and visually
        engaging web experiences using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
       </p>

       <p>
        My strength lies in building interfaces that are not only functional but 
        also aesthetically appealing and easy to use. I am continuously learning 
        new frameworks and tools to sharpen my skills and keep pace with modern 
        development trends.
</p>

         <p>
        Beyond coding, I bring creativity, attention to detail, and consistency to 
        every project I work on. My goal is to grow as a software engineer while 
        contributing to projects that make a real difference.
         </p>
